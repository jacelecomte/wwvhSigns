    <h1> Warren Woods Veterinary Hospital Vaccine Consent Form </h1>
    <p id="HospInfo"></p>

    <p>
        Warren Woods Veterinary Hospital is continuing to provide the best recommendations for the optimum health of
        your pet. Vaccine recommendations are currently being researched by various veterinary health organizations and
        are in the process of being modified. Currently the American Veterinary Medical Association is recommending core
        vaccination programs be developed by veterinarians based on the patients lifestyle and risk factors. Core vaccines are considered those that protect
        them from diseases that are widely distributed in the region, virulent, and highly infectious, thereby posing a risk of severe disease.
        Core vaccines are efficacious and exhibit patient benefit: risk ratios high enough to warrant their use, and/or are of considerable public
        health significance, or required by law.<br><br>

        <b>Core Vaccines at Warren Woods Veterinary Hospital include:</b><br> <b>Canine:</b> Rabies, Distemper aka DHLPP
        - Distemper, Hepatitis, Leptospirosis, Parainfluenza, and Parvovirus.<br>
        <b>Feline:</b> Rabies, Distemper aka FVRCP - Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus, and Panleukopenia. <br><br>

        <b>Non-core Vaccines include: </b> <br>
        <b> Canine: </b> Kennel Cough (Bordetella), Lyme, Influenza <br>
        <b> Feline: </b> Infectious Peritonitis and Leukemia.<br><br>

        Warren Woods Veterinary Hospital recommends vaccination with core vaccines to puppies and kittens every 3-4
        weeks until 16 weeks of age then an annual booster vaccination until five years of age. At five years of age
        vaccination protocols will be modified based on the patient's lifestyle and risk exposure (an exception to this protocol is the rabies vaccine that is
        governed by city and state regulations). In cases of adverse vaccine reaction by the patient, vaccinations may be stopped and titers may be
        recommended. Non-core vaccines will be given at the owner's and veterinarian's discretion based on the patient's exposure risk.<br>

        Although most pets respond well to vaccines, like any medical procedure, vaccination carries some risk. The most
        common adverse responses are mild and short-term, including fever, sluggishness and reduced appetite. Pets may
        also experience temporary pain or subtle swelling at the site of vaccination. Although most adverse responses will resolve within a day or two,
        excessive pain, swelling or listlessness should be discussed with your veterinarian.<br>
    </p>

    <p id="critical">
        Rarely, serious adverse responses occur. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your pet has repeated
        vomiting or diarrhea, whole body itching, difficulty breathing, collapse or swelling of the face or legs. These signs may indicate an
        allergic reaction. In very rare instances, death can occur. I have been advised of the risk and benefits related to vaccines and AGREE to vaccinate
        my pet with the vaccines recommended by Warren Woods Veterinary Hospital for this year. I understand that vaccinations can cause adverse reactions and
        agree to hold Warren Woods Veterinary Hospital harmless should my companion animal adversely react to a vaccine administered by an agent of Warren
        Woods Veterinary Hospital.
